# Chapter 0 

- Avoid reductions. Unless I'm reducing a trivial problem OR I plan to detailthe reduced problem elsewhere.
- This applies to where ever i'm communicating an algorithm.

### Steps to describing an algorithm (in class or interviews or whatever)

1. What: Specify the problem being solved
2. How:  A precise description of the algorithm
3. Why: A proof that the algorithm solves the problem.
4. How fast: An analysis of the running time of the algorithm.

Aim to describe things to someone less familiar with the problem that you are, so they could become acquainted with it. 

This is actually pretty practical for code documentation as a whole, so I'm keeping that in the brain for later.

This makes it easy both for anyone to work with your code and for you to go back and edit it, which is always the goal. 


Here Jeff says that "Your primary job as an algorithm deisgner is teaching other people how and why your algorithms work." If you can't communicate your ideas to other human beings, they may as well not exist. Producing correct and efficient executatble code is an important but secondary goal."

I think this important to keep in mind since my current struggle is understanding how many concepts are communicated, not with the concepts themselves. It would suck to do that to other people down the line.  


### Problem Specification

When specifying a problem (or documenting a function/method/subroutine):

Include just enough detail that the algorithm could be used as a black box.

Describe input and output types.

Describe how the output depends on the input. 

Hide any details that aren't necessary to use the algorithm as a black box. 


This is for the algorithm description(in code documention)
