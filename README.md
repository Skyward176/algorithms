# algorithms

### So basically, screw college.

I'm losing my grip on this algorithms class and I know I can do better.

This is a challenge to myself.

I'm spending some time with Jeff Erikson's Algorithms textbook, the command line, and good old C.

I'm going to work my way through the book and *actually understand* what is going on instead instead of writing endless math gibberish like a math major.

The way I'm learning at school isn't working for me, and I'm done throwing my hands in the air and watching my grades helplessly plummet.
